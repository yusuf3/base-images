# PHPDocker.io - PHP 7.2 / CLI & FPM container images

Ubuntu 18.04 PHP 7.2 CLI and FPM container images for [PHPDocker.io](http://phpdocker.io) projects. Packages are provided by [Ondřej Surý](https://deb.sury.org/).

Far smaller in size than PHP's official container. No need to compile any extensions: simply run `apt-get install php7.3-EXTENSION_NAME` as part of your Dockerfile

*Note on logging for FPM:* configure your application to stream logs into `php://stdout`. That's it. We do some trickery to remove FPM's `[pool www] child xxx said into stderr` messages from stdout when an app outputs to it.
